# Binary-Classification-of-Data-using-KNN-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest

In this project we are using the data to 

For each method selected, evaluate the performance of different parameters or different version of the algorithm considering the metrics(precision, recall, accuracy, etc). 
Based on the obtained results, comparing the best version of each method with the remaining ones.
however the essential steps the code includes are:
• Loading the dataset
• Spliting and cleaning the dataset
• Load and training the chosen classification methods and parameters
• Plotting the results for each method and parameter

The table include precision, recall, F1-Score and accuracy of all the three method.
